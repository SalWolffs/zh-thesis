\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
\ROUGH{We have shown that the phasefree ZH-calculus is complete, and discussed
the minimality of its axioms. Additionally, we've compiled a practical list of
rewrite rules for the phasefree ZH-calculus, which will of course also hold in
the full ZH-calculus and the phaseful fragment. Future work includes narrowing
the minimality of the phasefree axioms (most notably either dropping one of (O), (\&) or
proving their necessity). We also look forward to efforts expanding the
phaseful fragment, which would hopefully effectively combine the expressivity of the
phasefree ZH-calculus with that of the ZX-calculus while preserving
translatability to physical circuits.}
