\section{ZX analogues}
\ROUGH{The following rules will look familiar to those used to the ZX calculus.
They are true, useful, and easily proven. Since the proofs take up quite some
space and aren't particularly interesting, they are delegated to \autoref{chap:proofs}.}
\TODO{Add a table with all ZX-analogues laws here}

\section{The CZ-rule}
\begin{TODOLIST}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The rule
\item Its (brief) proof
\item Motivation (refer forward)
\end{enumerate}
\end{TODOLIST}

\section{Generalising the Ortho rule}
\ROUGH{Appendix B of \cite{backens2018zhcalculus} goes a long way towards
generalizing the (O) rule, but specialises it for their specific use case in
normal forms. We will repeat their proof here in shortened form, but add some
extra !-boxes and drop parameters to make it applicable to our case.
Additionally, we will add the relevant scalars. 

Having proven a more accessible form, we will then prove a different
generalisation before stating and proving a form which combines both. }

\section{Worked example: proving the idempotence rule}
\NOTE{This is the Z-H connection deduplication rule. Essentially, here goes the
last bit of Appendix D of (cite Wetering\&Wolffs), but with more elaboration.}
\section{Working with $\Delta$}
\begin{TODOLIST}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Various shapes of $\Delta$ (note most common/useful one)
\item Rewrite rules involving $\Delta$
\item Proofs, or reference to \autoref{chap:proofs}
\end{enumerate}
\end{TODOLIST}


\section{The laws}
\ROUGH{Following the example of \cite[Ch.~10.3]{CKbook}, we conclude this chapter with a
complete list of all the laws we have found and consider useful. [FIXME: replace
with actual cases] have not been proven yet, their proofs can be found at the
end of \autoref{chap:proofs} . All the others have been mentioned and proven before. }

\begin{TODOLIST}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The axioms and definitions
\item Alternate forms of some axioms and definitions (e.g. (NOT), (\&),
($\Delta$))
\item Clearly marked repetition of all rules proven in
\cite{backens2018zhcalculus}
\item Rules from sections in this chapter
\item Anything else
\end{enumerate}
\end{TODOLIST}
