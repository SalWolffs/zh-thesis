\chapter{The phasefree ZH-calculus}\label{chap:phasefree}
\section{Non-physicality of free parameters}
\section{Restricting parameters to phases}
\NOTE{Briefly. Mostly to justify name "phasefree" rather than "parameterfree".
Note that this has merit but is not our subject and move on.}
\section{Eliminating parameters entirely}
\section{Theorems from the full ZH Calculus}
\section{Adding the triangle}
\section{The axioms of the phasefree ZH-calculus}
\NOTE{Add proofs of eliminated axioms here?}
